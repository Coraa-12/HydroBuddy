# **HydroBuddy** üö∞

**HydroBuddy** is a simple yet effective hydration reminder application designed to help you stay hydrated throughout the day. It now features both a **graphical user interface (GUI)** and a **command-line interface (CLI)**. The application sends desktop notifications at regular intervals, plays a sound alert, and logs each reminder to a file.
